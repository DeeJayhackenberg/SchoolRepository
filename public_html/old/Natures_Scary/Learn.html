		          The lifecycle of the monarch <a href="http://sandiegozoo.org/animalbytes/t-butterfly.html">butterfly</a> captures the imagination of schoolchildren and scientists alike. Although  monarch butterflies are found throughout the world, the North American  population living east of the Rocky Mountains  engages in a phenomenon that is as unique as it is amazing. Each fall, the  entire population of several hundred million monarchs flies up to 3,000 miles (4,800  kilometers) to communally roost in a small forest region in Mexico for the  winter. There, in the mountains of central Mexico, the monarchs will cluster  together by the tens of thousands, literally covering their arboreal roosts. <br>
		          The monarchs&rsquo; forest home is owned by groups of peasant  farmers organized into groups called ejidos. There are about 100 different  communities or private land owners that have land within the Monarch Butterfly  Biosphere Reserve. The monarchs and their home are protected by a Mexican  presidential decree made in 2000. But for a number of reasons, the forest is  still being cut. </p>
                  <p>Concerned Conservationists<br>
                The San Diego Zoo is working with Mexican, American, and  Canadian collaborators to help protect the winter forest home of the monarchs.  The Zoo carries out a variety of projects including guide training,  reforestation, fuel-efficient stove construction, supporting community  initiatives to combat illegal logging, educational programs for children and  adults, and alternative income projects, such as the women&rsquo;s community  pine-needle basket cooperative.</p></td>
