You embrace the Blizzard style that&rsquo;s persisted throughout our games—recognizable silhouettes and strong colors that guide players and add clarity and cohesion. You can paint muscle-bound orcs or glittering starscapes without sacrificing usability.</p>
              <p>You&rsquo;ll work with a variety of tools, from pencil and paper to texturing software, to make fantasies real and craft inviting worlds that spark the imagination of your peers. The beautiful (or terrifying) images you create aren&rsquo;t just for appreciating—they&rsquo;ll ultimately support and inform gameplay.</p>

You&rsquo;ll construct mechanics that don&rsquo;t require a manual to understand, keeping in mind that the best games are easy to learn, but difficult to master. It&rsquo;ll be your job to create fun for everyone, from hardcore competitors to plug-and-play weekend gamers.</p>
              <p>Blizzard designers aren&rsquo;t just &ldquo;idea people&rdquo;—they find elegant and enduring designs everywhere, and implement them effectively with scripting, layout and testing. With world editing software at your fingertips, you&rsquo;ll iterate until your gameplay shines as brightly as any gorgeous environment or stirring soundtrack. When your co-workers can&rsquo;t stop playing what you&rsquo;ve made, then you&rsquo;ll know you&rsquo;ve found the fun.</p>

They distill complex code into straightforward processes that help create content more efficiently and enable increasingly impressive games. They maintain complex databases of abilities, accounts and characters throughout more than a dozen regions worldwide. Good engineering is all about empowerment—empowering a creative team to craft amazing gameplay, and empowering players to enjoy it beyond their wildest dreams.</p>
              <p>As an engineer, you&rsquo;ll code the heart of player experiences, always aiming to enhance the amount of fun they&rsquo;re having and deepen their relationship with their games. You&rsquo;ll push the boundaries of what&rsquo;s possible in a video game—because it&rsquo;s more fun that way.</p>

              <p>A producer&rsquo;s primary goal is to keep fellow team members free of impediments that could impair their work. Blizzard producers aren&rsquo;t &ldquo;in charge&rdquo;—instead, with project management tools, tremendous empathy, and team-wide communication, they&rsquo;re the life-saving handhold in the hurricane of game development. Producers make sure no stone is left unturned, no checklist is left ignored, no deadline is missed or rushed.</p>
              <p>Blizzard production prides itself on keeping engineers coding, artists drawing, and designers making fun game systems. Anything that gets in the way of other disciplines being able to work is a producer&rsquo;s job to solve. Producers create the environment that makes Blizzard products and services possible, and champion the Blizzard vision to their team so that they never veer off course.</p>
              <p>When they&rsquo;re polishing the fourth pass of a level or the latest UI revision, they&rsquo;ll thank you for it. Because, without your guidance and shepherding, the magic doesn&rsquo;t happen. Make it so.</p>              <h3>&nbsp;</h3></td>

            <td><p>Blizzard games don&rsquo;t just begin with game ideas, or end once those games are released. A lot more goes into the creation of a Blizzard product than the work of developers—and we support our games for years after they&rsquo;re in the hands of gamers world-wide.</p>
              <p>Many of us are programmers and artists, but there are more unique jobs at Blizzard than you might imagine. We handle marketing, promotion, public relations, music composition, and even more work related to our games in-house, to make sure everything we do is polished until it shines.</p>
              <p>Below is a list of roles at Blizzard that contribute to game creation and support. Though we&rsquo;re not always hiring for these specialized areas, please send us your resume anyway if a department looks right for you and you&rsquo;ve got an extreme passion for gaming. It takes a diverse, capable, nearly-fanatical group of people to bring our dream games to life.</p></td>
